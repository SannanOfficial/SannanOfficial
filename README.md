Hi there ðŸ‘‹
GitHub gave me a template for things to write about myself, so here goes nothing:

  ðŸ’¬ Ask me about coding, cooking, and games. However, I do not promise you that I have sufficient knowledge in any of those.
  ðŸ“« Email: syedmohammadsannan7@gmail.com
  ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him.
  âš¡ Fun fact: Facts aren't fun, fantasies are.

Anyway, none of that is important. What's important is that I post miscellaneous stuff here from myself w.r.t. coding.
